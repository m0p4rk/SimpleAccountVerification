# Git Practice Account Login Simulation

This project is a simple Java application used for Git workflow practice. It simulates a login process for an admin user. The code is intentionally basic and not secure, meant for demonstrating Git branching and merging practices.

## Warning

This code is for educational purposes only and is intentionally simplistic and not secure. It should not be used in production environments.

## Features

- Admin login simulation with hardcoded credentials.
- Success and failure message display based on login attempt.
- Password encryption display simulation (Note: this is not actual encryption, just a placeholder for demonstration).

## Prerequisites

To run this application, you will need:

- Java Development Kit (JDK), version 8 or higher.

## Running the Application

1. Compile the `Account.java` file:
   ```
   javac Account.java
   ```

2. Run the compiled class:
   ```
   java Account
   ```

3. Enter the username and password as prompted in the console.

## How to Use

- The application prompts for username and password.
- Enter `admin` as the username and `passadmin` as the password for a successful login.
- Any other input will result in a failed login attempt.

## Contributing

As this is a practice project for Git workflow, you are encouraged to:

- Fork the repository.
- Create a new branch for your feature or fix.
- Commit your changes with meaningful commit messages.
- Push your changes and create a pull request.

## Disclaimer

This project is for demonstration purposes and does not implement real authentication measures. The password is displayed in the console, which is a security risk and should never be done in a real-world application.
